# ValorantVibration
ValorantVibration is a little piece of software written in C# that uses [NVAPI](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvapi) to tweak the game colors and make it more vibrant.

# Contributing
Feel free to contribute to the project however you can.

Note: I have an NVIDIA card, so if you have an AMD card and would like to make it AMD compatible, you rock!
